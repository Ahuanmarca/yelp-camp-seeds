# YelpCamp Seed Database Script

This script fills my YelpCamp database with 30 randomly generated campgrounds.

Unsplash and unsplash-js package are used to get the images.

Unsplash API Key is needed. An error will occurr if none is provided.

.env.example

```
MONGO_URL=""
MONGO_DB_NAME=""
UNSPLASH_API_KEY=""
```

To run, simply do:

```
node index.js
```
